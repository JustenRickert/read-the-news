  "content": "WASHINGTON — It wasn’t just the GOP that tried to undermine the credibility of Lt. Col. Alex Vindman on the stand Tuesday. It was the White House itself.
The White House’s official Twitter account slammed Vindman — who remains a White House staffer, by the way — as having had his judgement questioned by his former boss, Tim Morrison, the White House’s former top adviser on Russia and Europe.
“Tim Morrison, Alexander Vindman's former boss, testified in his deposition that he had concerns about Vindman's judgment,” the account tweeted, an extraordinary statement directed at a sitting U.S. official by his employer.
Here's where it gets really awkward: Morrison is set to take his turn in front of the House Intelligence Committee later this afternoon where he'll no doubt be asked to elaborate.
The tweet came in concert with questioning from members of the House GOP, who tried to paint him as a dual agent with little loyalty to the U.S., the White House’s official Twitter account jumped into the fray.
Vindman, a Purple Heart recipient who serves as the director for European Affairs for the U.S. National Security Council, still works for the government.
Over the course of the public impeachment hearings, Democrats have accused President Trump of witness intimidation for his attacks on the government officials testifying under subpoena in front of the House as part of its impeachment inquiry.
In his opening statement Tuesday, Vindman assured his father, who immigrated to the U.S. from Ukraine when Vindman was a toddler, that he wouldn’t face retribution for testifying.
\\"Do not worry,” Vindman said he told his dad. “I will be fine for telling the truth.\\"",

  "content": "You can buy a belly button online. It can be an innie, outtie, twisted to the left or the right, and placed on a virtual body. You can also buy a variety of penises, pubic hair, breasts, and tongues, all of which can be tweaked to look however you want. Cobble these together, use a photograph to algorithmically generate a person’s face, and you might be able to make a 3D avatar of someone who is walking around in real life. Import them into another program, and you can have sex with them in virtual reality, without that person ever giving consent.
On forums like Reddit, marketplaces like Patreon, and on standalone websites, communities of anonymous users are making, selling, and getting off to the computer-generated likenesses of celebrities and other real people. The 3D models that emerge from these communities can be articulated into any position, animated, modified, interacted with in real time, and manipulated in ways that defy the constraints of physical reality.
Today, the results are mostly crude. Unlike the most sophisticated deepfake videos traded online, no one is going to mistake any of the 3D models Motherboard has seen during our reporting for actual images of a real person. But the technology to create photorealistic 3D models of real people is rapidly approaching—and it's getting easier for the average user to access those tools and programs.
Some software that's already available automates much of the process for creating the 3D likenesses of real people. Rendering a realistic human is a process which historically required the specialized technical knowledge of teams of artists in game and special effects studios. Those studios, traditionally, have to obtain the rights to use someone's likeness before rendering them, but many hobbyists seemingly make avatars of anyone, with or without their consent.
\\"I use it to fulfill my sexual fantasies or replicate sexual encounters with my ex-girlfriends,\\" one user commented on a subreddit dedicated to creating 3D adult content with Virt-A-Mate (also known as VaM), software for creating adult VR games and simulations. The user was specifically talking about Foto2Vam, a program that uses a photograph of a real person's face to automatically generate a 3D model with the same face, which can then be used in VR.
\\"Foto2vam has enabled me to literally feel like I'm there again, i.e. getting a handjob/footjob from my ex looking at me with a smile, or having another ex ride me on the floor in reverse cowgirl in front of a mirror...the possibilities are endless,\\" the user said.
Another user on the same thread said they also use Foto2Vam to render ex-girlfriends performing sexual acts. They wrote that some 3D models turn out better than others depending on how many quality photographs of the person they can work with.
\\"From now on, we need to make sure we ask girlfriends to pose a few different angles with a blank expression and flat lighting for a few photos and then import them into VaM,\\" they said. \\"Oh, and I find it amusing to alter reality and give them boob implants, etc. ;)\\"
Another user explained that they've previously created adult content using Daz 3D—a software for creating 3D models of people that is popular with hobbyists because it's free—but that VaM has fulfilled their dream of interacting with that content in virtual reality. They explained that they recreate real people using a combination of well known, commercial, or free software like Photoshop, Daz 3D, the digital sculpting tool ZBrush, and FaceGen, software similar to Foto2Vam which also generates 3D faces using photographs. These tools aren’t secret; they’re widely used for creating video games, special effects in movies, and other non-pornographic content.
\\"My biggest wish for the future is to get even [more] photo-realistic girls! Better hair creation, better clothes, shaders... there are still a lot of things to make it even better!\\" that user said. \\"I want to say 'thank you' to MeshedVR [the creator of VaM] for this!\\"
On a Discord channel dedicated to VaM, one user explained that there's nothing people can do to stop VaM creators from making adult content using their likeness, especially public figures:
\\"Everyone jacks off to everyone, it's human nature, you can't stop it unless you just stay off grid and never go anywhere or show anywhere and nobody knows you even exist...It's our world and freedom, they can't stop us from jacking off, nobody can, they can merely choose extreme privacy,\\" that user said.
None of the users posting publicly about making real people replied to our request for comment, but some deleted their posts after we contacted them.
Inside the world of bespoke, 3D-rendered porn
There's nothing inherently wrong with 3D-rendered porn. People have been using computer graphics to create adult content for decades. Second Life still has a large community focused on adult content, and video game assets are often modified to create porn, sometimes featuring the likeness of real actors. Sites like Pornhub are filled with 3D-rendered porn videos.
But VaM and the community around it, including the 7,600 members of its active subreddit, are different because they make it relatively trivial to create a 3D model that looks like someone who exists in the real world and share it with others.
Users can then use those 3D models to create still images and animated videos, or have sex with them using a VR headset and a connected sex toy like the Fleshlight Launch, which automatically strokes the person's penis in sync with action on screen. The communities that are currently trading in these 3D models prove that there is an audience for this type of customizable adult content, a creator class that is willing to do the work to provide it, and an online infrastructure for both creators and bigger corporations like Patreon, Reddit, and Daz which already profit from it.
There are many ways for a person get custom 3D-rendered porn. According to a community wiki, the free version of VaM gives users access to a single \\"scene\\" and model, whose body they can modify with a series of sliders, and position by manipulating different body parts in real time. Users who contribute to the VaM Patreon get more interactive and customization features in VaM, like the ability to download scenes made by other creators in the community, customize hair and clothing, and \\"manually undress models by pulling the clothes off with your in-game hands.\\"
The VaM community wiki also instructs users how to create faces using reference photos, create their own animations, and import full models or individual body parts created by other users. For example, the wiki instructs users how to give a 3D model a realistic vagina by downloading one from Renderotica, a community and marketplace for 3D-rendered porn. In 3D modeling this item is called a \\"morph,\\" which broadly refers to a method for changing the shape of 3D models. A list of compatible morphs in the wiki includes \\"8 orgasm expression morphs,\\" \\"a large balls morph,\\" and \\"the cherry on top of your blowjob collection, introducing a brand new set of lip morphs.\\" Users can also import existing, compatible 3D models created with Daz 3D into VaM.
Nonconsensual use of people's likenesses is a controversial topic in 3D-rendered porn communities.
\\"There are requests from some people in the forums that go along the lines of 'Hey, if I give you a picture of my wife or girlfriend, can you make a model look like her?'\\" a creator named Davos told Motherboard. Davos sells extreme fetish accessories and scenes on Renderotica. It's a site where creators like Davos sell adult comics created with 3D models, or 3D body parts that can be modify Daz 3D models.
\\"Nobody wants to be responsible for somebody doing something hateful or vengeful on a real person,\\" Davos said. \\"My personal take is, it's okay if you change the name and are willing to take the risk of possibly being told to stop by a nasty letter from a corporate lawyer.\\"
Another creator of 3D human models that are used in adult content and whose work is supported on Patreon was adamant that the VaM community isn't all about porn, and isn't all about recreating real people, either.
\\"VaM is really no different than any other adult-oriented game... and is one of the less controversial adult projects, a sandbox that allows users to create their own fantasies,\\" he said. \\"VaM admins and the developer are one of the few I saw [who are] very very worried about keeping things under control and on a good reputation... Dark aspects have to be expected from porn communities but those can be kept under control.\\"
Sharing 3D-rendered celebrities for interactive porn
The VaM community subreddit's rules instruct members not to post images, videos, or scenes \\"that could be considered illegal, strongly offensive, or immoral,\\" but has no stated rule about posting 3D models or adult content of real people. In fact, the rules explicitly allow users to post 3D renderings of celebrities as long as they don't include real photos or use their real names in the post: \\"Abbreviations, nicknames and different names are perfectly fine,\\" the rules state.
Not surprisingly, because of the availability of high-quality photos of them online, and simply because people love to fantasize about unattainable public figures, sharing 3D models of celebrities is one of the most common activities in the community. Motherboard has found dozens of 3D models of celebrities including Emilia Clarke, Natalie Portman, Emma Watson, and Nicki Minaj—most under nicknames, per the rules. The celebrities are recognizable on sight, and sometimes their fake name alluded to their real name, or their identity is referred to in user comments. Almost all the 3D models we saw were of women, but we spotted at least two 3D models of men: Joaquin Phoenix and Chris Pratt.
These posts usually include a link to a file sharing site where other users can download the 3D model and use it themselves, and sometimes a Patreon page, which some creators use to collect money for their work.
Studies show that women are the most common targets of nonconsensual porn, and abusive manipulated imagery like deepfakes. Experts and victims alike say that even if it's not \\"real,\\" the experience of seeing one's likeness in nonconsensual porn spread across the internet is legitimate trauma, similar to sexual assault, and not very different from actual revenge porn or spreading sex tapes and nudes without consent.
One creator in the community who uses Twitter to share their work—including a 3D model of an almost-nude celebrity tied up, her face covered in viscous white fluid—said that he has been making 3D models and characters professionally for video games, television, and other commercial videos and simulations for 30 years.
\\"I mainly create VaM looks and scenes for myself, although I have shared screenshots of my creations, sometimes the full file, for free to the VaM community,\\" he said. \\"My primary motivation in sharing my files with the community, has been to create interest in the software, [and] bring in more experienced developers who can help grow VaM into a robust VR sandbox.\\"
He added that he has created 3D models of real people he knew, sometimes with their permission. He has also made nonsexual content, like being able to see what he and his wife would look like in a kitchen remodel they considered.
\\"I also created an ex-gf, just to be able to sit across the table from them one more time. Personally, I see it as nothing more than creating clay busts, or notebook sketches of fond memories and faces,\\" he said. \\"I do not distribute any IRL content that I have created, with or without permission, as I prefer to remain anonymous.\\"
But he did not have the same standard for celebrities.
\\"I enjoyed creating celebrity looks as an homage, and in some cases, in sexual situations,\\" they said. \\"As sexuality is a universal human experience, I don't see a problem with it.\\"
Mesh VR, the company that owns VaM, also collects money via Patreon. The founder of Mesh VR, who goes by MeshedVR online, told us they couldn't say for sure how many people use VaM, but almost 8,000 people support it on Patreon.
They said that they know people use the software to make characters from movies and TV shows and interact with them in VR, and feel that it's \\"OK\\" as long as the model is mimicking a popular fictional character like Batgirl, for example. But they don't condone creating real people without permission.
\\"I know people go beyond this and try to recreate real-life people, without consent,\\" MeshedVR said. \\"For me that is a slippery slope, and is wrought with legal and ethical concerns. I don't include any look-alikes in VaM for this reason, and I have worked with moderators on various sites to help establish rules against creating look-alikes of real people. If someone were to post a recreation of an ex, I would ask it to be removed. On my Discord server, I would remove it myself, since I consider that to be an official server for VaM.\\"
MeshedVR told us that while they are listed as a moderator on the subreddit, consulted on its rules (which allow sharing celebrities), and often browse it to see what the community has come up with, they're not an active moderator there.
\\"If I see something questionable (models too young looking, celebrity look-alikes, violent act recreation, etc.), I alert the mods, but most times they have already handled it if there is an issue,\\" they said. \\"I view VaM as a creative tool, like Blender, or Photoshop. What people do with it is largely out of my control.\\"
Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief operating officer and general counsel for the actors' union SAG-AFTRA, told Motherboard that actors can take legal action against people selling 3D models of their likeness by invoking rights of publicity, which close to half the states in the United States currently have. But those laws vary by state, and for ordinary individuals who don't have a famous face, there may be little legal recourse.
\\"They have legal ability to challenge that, but we have to recognize that is quite burdensome,\\" Crabtree-Ireland said. \\"They have to hire a lawyer, file a lawsuit, and if the performer has to spend $10,000 to file a lawsuit against each person who used their likeness, that's not the most effective way to address it.\\"
SAG-AFTRA supported a law against deepfake videos that recently passed in California and hopes to pass a similar law in New York, but Crabtree-Ireland said that even new laws won't stop nonconsensual use of someone's likeness entirely.
\\"There will always be stuff that lingers around the edges and grey areas that are harder to deal with, but if we could make a dent in the rather extraordinary volume of stuff that's going on that will be welcomed and beneficial to the people who are the targets of it,\\" he said. \\"It's not going to be absolute or perfect, but it's better than the Wild West situation we're in at the moment.\\"
\\"Of course people are going to do that.\\"
John Danaher, a senior lecturer in law at the National University of Ireland Galway and coeditor of the book  Robot Sex: Social and Ethical Implications, told Motherboard that images and representations like this could be viewed as a type of revenge porn if they're created or shared without consent.
\\"Is this something the other person wants? Is it mutually desirable/pleasurable? I don't think anyone should be creating representations of this sort without the consent of the real person,\\" Danaher said. \\"I also think anyone who might want to make such an image of themselves should think about the possibility of the representations being stolen, shared, and used for malicious purposes at a later point.\\"
Ultimately, a pornographic image created with VaM doesn't look meaningfully different than a drawn or Photoshopped pornographic image, or other 3D-rendered porn, all of which have have been used to create nonconsensual porn for decades. The difference here, much like it was with deepfakes, is that new technologies have democratized the tools for creating this kind of adult content, making them cheaper and easier to use.
The plug-and-play nature of VaM makes it so a user doesn't need to make their own 3D model of a celebrity in order to have sex with it in VR; they can just download a 3D model that someone else in the community has made. Even tools and platforms that are not specifically for adult content enable this—Daz 3D, the popular and free 3D modeling tool, has a store where users can upload and sell their creations. It didn't take much searching to find 3D models of real people like Natalie Portman and Lupita Nyong'o (on sale on that store for $19.95 and $18.95, respectively). These models can be bought, downloaded, and combined with other tools like VaM to create nonconsensual porn. After browsing Daz 3D, we were also targeted with ads of generic, scantily clad 3D models of women that invited us to \\"get her now.\\" Daz 3D did not respond to our request for comment.
Kyle Machulis, who creates open source software for controlling sex toys, discovered the VaM community because it was using his tools to connect VaM to a Fleshlight Launch, an automated masturbation device. This way, for example, when a character in VaM moved her hand up and down a virtual penis, the Launch strokes the user's real penis in sync, creating a more immersive experience.
Machulis asked users in the VaM subreddit how, exactly, they use the sex simulator. He told Motherboard that he was a little surprised by the answers.
\\"The fact that I was surprised people would make exes probably says more about me and my naivety than it does about the community,\\" he said. \\"Of course people are going to do that. They're visualizing memories burned into their neurons, adding audio/visual (and now possibly haptic) reality to whatever scraps of time are left in their brain.\\"
Some people in these communities told us they make 3D avatars of real people because it's cathartic, or because they just like the aesthetics, but they almost always do it to women's bodies. Danaher said that it is potentially unhealthy to hold on to the past in this way, but the people in this community that Motherboard talked to said that programs like VaM are a way to get back to a time or a feeling they can't get back to otherwise.
\\"Memories exist in [our] heads, memorabilia exists in our physical storage,\\" Machulis said. \\"When those memories are brought into a digital environment like VaM, Second Life, etc, things get real complicated, real quick.\\"",

  "content": "WASHINGTON — What do Trump's chief of staff, top National Security Counsel lawyer and John Bolton's deputy have in common? They’ve all gotten mixed up in a lawsuit against the president.
It may sound counterintuitive, but Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney’s botched attempt to slap a lawsuit on Trump was actually his way of trying to help bolster the White House ban on officials testifying before the impeachment inquiry.
In the most basic sense, these officials want the courts to decide who they should listen to: Congress or Trump?
The decision could have particular impact for one high-profile witness: Former NSC chief John Bolton, whose lawyers teased he has information they haven’t heard about relevant meetings and conversations central to the impeachment inquiry.
At this point, House Democrats just want to drop the whole thing, while Bolton’s lawyers insist the judge should render a decision as quickly as possible.
Either way, it’s unlikely to be fully resolved in time, said Carl Tobias, an expert on the judiciary system at the University of Richmond School of Law.
“The whole Trump legal gambit is to get to November 2020, and time is on their side,” Tobias said. “That’s just the practical reality of the time it takes the courts to move.”
Here’s what’s going on with this bizarre tangle of a lawsuit at the center of the impeachment inquiry.
Bolton Gonna Bolton
Though his name isn’t officially on the complaint, the lawsuit centers on Bolton, whose muddied position on impeachment has left plenty for both Trump and the Democrats to get upset about.
Bolton’s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, kicked the whole thing into gear in October by suing Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Chairs of Congressional committees, asking a judge to decide whether he should answer his own Congressional subpoena to testify, or observe the White House’s order to resist.
Kupperman’s lawsuit was widely viewed as a trial balloon for Bolton, who shares the same lawyer.
Democrats replied they have no patience for waiting around for the courts to sort all this out — and suggested they would lump Kupperman and Bolton’s resistance with other acts of defiance by the White House into a second article of impeachment for obstructing Congress.
Then things started to get messy:
Democrats dropped their subpoena, asking the judge to dismiss Kupperman’s lawsuit.
But the judge refused, allowing the case to proceed.
Bolton’s lawyer taunted Democrats to subpoena him, too, saying he knows about important, secret stuff they haven’t heard yet.
Democrats refused, accusing Bolton of just trying to delay their impeachment inquiry.
Mulvaney then tried to join the Kupperman suit, presenting the surreal spectacle of the White House Chief of Staff filing to sue his own boss, the President of the United States.
Kupperman tried to block Mulvaney, calling him a stand-in for Trump’s interests in the case and arguing he’d said too much in public, anyway.
The judge agreed: Mulvaney had to go.
Mulvaney dropped out Monday night, promising to file his own parallel lawsuit.
But on Tuesday morning, Mulvaney changed his mind, saying he wouldn’t bother.
Meanwhile, another key witness for Democrats, John Eisenberg, told Democrats that he would abide by whatever decision is reached in the Kupperman lawsuit over whether to testify or not.
As a result, this messy legal dispute has now snowballed to potentially determine the future plans of at least three witnesses from the very top ranks of Trump’s White House: Bolton, Eisenberg and Kupperman.
And maybe more, if other officials decide to align their own fate with the case as well.
For now, the judge assigned to the case has been moving along at a pace that outside legal observers call leisurely by impeachment-crisis standards, but which the judge has repeatedly defended as fast enough.
He’s told everyone in the case that he wants oral arguments on December 10, just days before Democrats year-end deadline on impeachment.
That means an initial decision could drop in mid-December, right before the House wraps up its impeachment proceedings, raising the question of whether Bolton and Kupperman might view that verdict as sufficient justification to address Congress. Alternatively, they might hold out for the appeals process, which could reach all the way up to the Supreme Court.
Taking the latter path could easily take months — a delay Democrats have repeatedly said they won’t sit around waiting for.",

  "content": "There’s a chilling calculation that’s simple enough to solve on the back of an envelope: How many children’s lives will Kevin Esvelt personally be responsible for if he makes one mistake on the job?
Depending on the variables, the final figure could be between 25,000 and 2.5 million. Even the lower end of that range is horrifying. “Just imagine 25,000 dead children. It’s nearly impossible. That’s like a third of the children in Boston,” Esvelt said, gesturing out his window at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “Because I said the wrong thing. Because I failed to think about the consequences of my actions.”
Esvelt doesn’t need the envelope, because the calculation is continuously running in his mind: It’s a rough estimate of the number of people who could die from malaria in the next 10 years. Those same lives could potentially be saved with CRISPR-based gene drive—a technology that the evolutionary engineer conceptualized in 2013 and told the world about in 2014.
When an organism sexually reproduces, its genes have a 50/50 chance of being passed to its offspring. A CRISPR gene drive is a way to override those odds, and make it nearly certain that a trait will be inherited. It could be used to make all of a mosquito’s offspring male, for example, rendering their reproduction nearly impossible and depleting a species that kills more than half a million people per year, most of them kids. In a darker vision of the future, a gene drive could accidentally cause unforeseen ecological consequences, and turn the public against it, preventing its use.
“Nothing in my training had prepared me for that,” Esvelt recalled. Gene drive shifted his career and identity from being just a scientist in a lab to someone bound to the concern about how new technologies will challenge the ways we structure research, make policy decisions, and inform the public about choices that will affect their environments.
Esvelt has leaned in to it, making a name for himself as the morality guy. “Not since Robert Oppenheimer has a scientist worked so hard against the proliferation of his own creation,” declared a 2018  Pacific Standard profile of gene drive technology. But in the end, Esvelt’s efforts are not really about gene drive. As we await other powerful technologies to be invented—capable of fundamentally changing our environments, DNA, or health—Esvelt wants to use gene drive to set up some moral guidelines for how science and humanity decide to wield such tools, no matter what they are. Gene drive can help prepare us for whatever comes after it—the  next technology that has the potential for great good, and also for great destruction.
I met Esvelt on a gray weekday morning in September, in an older part of the MIT Media Lab’s chic, glassy building in Kendall Square. The Media Lab was in the midst of a scandal regarding its director Joi Ito’s ties to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but Esvelt made clear that he couldn’t comment on it until the investigation by MIT’s external law firm was complete. At eight thirty, the whole floor was deserted. As I waited, I wandered around the vacant cluttered desks and peered into a fish tank containing a sleeping axolotl, a cartoonish amphibian with gills that frame its face like a headdress.
Esvelt arrived a few minutes late, mentioning a delayed train, and we entered his office—surprisingly cramped for a man navigating such expansive responsibility. Plants lined the far wall, and he pulled out a huge plastic jug and dumped water on them while he opened the window. He apologized if I felt chilly, but informed me in a matter-of-fact tone that research has shown that CO2 can build up in rooms with closed doors and windows.
Lanky and pale, with a jumpy, frenetic presence, Esvelt was wearing shorts, sandals, and a blue button-down shirt that emphasized the blue of his eyes. His clothes were crisp and clean, but they looked like an afterthought, as if someone else had laid them out on a bed for him. One of Esvelt’s colleagues likened him to Doogie Howser, the fictional teenage doctor, and his face does have an exaggeratedly youthful pallor—he could pass for much younger than his 37 years.
When Esvelt  was younger, he was a fellow at Harvard University’s Wyss Institute, working with the renowned geneticist George Church and a group studying CRISPR/Cas 9, a bacterial defense system that has been adapted into a gene-editing tool. Some bacteria store pieces of virus DNA from previous attacks and then use an enzyme, Cas 9, to chop up any DNA they encounter in the future that matches those fragments.
Scientists realized that they could manipulate this system to cut  any DNA sequence they wanted, by changing the DNA that CRISPR/Cas 9 used as its guide. As a gene editing technology, CRISPR single-handedly revolutionized the field by offering a way to precisely cut DNA. But Esvelt was bored. He’d been working on CRISPR for around nine months, and that was long enough for him to predict the majority of what its future applications would be. Or so he thought.
On a spring day in 2013, Esvelt passed through Emerald Necklace, a park on the way from Boston's subway to the Longwood Medical area. As he walked through the greenery, he thought about how evolution would overpower whatever CRISPR edits a scientist made to an animal’s DNA.
Organisms that sexually reproduce get two copies of each gene, one from each parent. Let’s say a scientist edited a mosquito: When that genetically modified mosquito mated with an unmodified one, only one copy of the edited gene would get passed down. This would dilute the genetic modification after just a few generations, especially if the edit wasn’t benefiting the mosquito’s survival.
But what if you could use CRISPR to edit a mosquito to have a new gene  and carry the tools to alter that gene in its offspring, too? When an edited mosquito mated with an unedited one, the offspring would inherit a CRISPR system that would chop away the second, unedited version of the gene.
When there’s DNA damage to one gene, a cell tries to repair it, using the other copy as a template. In this case, the other copy would be modified, and the mosquito would be left with two copies of the edited gene, guaranteed to pass it along to its offspring. The change would sweep through a population without human intervention after only a few edited mosquitoes were released into nature.
The idea was a riff on something called a gene drive, which occurs naturally in biology: It's when a gene proliferates throughout a species, even if it's not necessarily contributing to the survival of the organism. Since the 1940s, scientists have tried to harness gene drives for public health. In 2003, the biologist Austin Burt proposed that a gene drive could be used to stop malaria, but actually creating a gene drive was expensive and difficult. Esvelt’s insight of using CRISPR to facilitate gene drive was the missing ingredient to make it not only feasible, but relatively easy.
Esvelt was elated. Burt was right—a gene drive could, theoretically, be used to eradicate malaria, but that was only the beginning of what a CRISPR gene drive could do. It could address all the other mosquito-borne illnesses and other diseases that jump from animal populations into people. \\"If we edited all the wild birds to be immune to influenza, then you wouldn’t have avian flu jumping into humans and pigs and jumping into us,\\" Esvelt said. \\"We could edit all of the parasitic worms that cause so much suffering.”
After a full day of marveling at the possibilities, this honeymoon period came to a sudden halt. It wasn’t that “we” could do anything—one  single scientist could do it. Esvelt could do it on his own. CRISPR was a simple tool, and he had access to it at his own lab, as did many others.
“I thought,  Whoa, whoa, whoa,” Esvelt said. “It’s one thing for humanity to be able to do this. It’s quite another for individual researchers to have this kind of power.” He started to spiral: How dangerous was his idea—what ripple effects on an ecosystem could changing the DNA of one species have? Would it be uncontrollable—since CRISPR gene drives would be self-propagating, could it be stopped if something went wrong? Could it be blocked? How fast would it be? Could it be detectable—or could someone release a gene drive in secret? Esvelt ruminated for a couple of weeks, then he went to George Church, and asked for advice.
Church told me that when he first hired Esvelt, he didn’t see him as particularly interested in safety, ethics, or policy. “It was only when they started talking about gene drives that he started to get antsy,” Church said. “And everything followed from that point on.”
When Esvelt finally did publish his gene drive paper with several of his coworkers in  eLife in 2014, they intentionally hadn’t executed it yet. They wanted to introduce the concept, consult with experts in various disciplines, and invite criticism; a majority of the paper is about safety, control, and ethical concerns. When they did make a drive for the first time in 2015, in yeast, they simultaneously built a second drive that overwrote the first and restored it. “Reversibility was one of the first things that we worried about,” Church said.
In the spirit of harnessing CRISPR gene drive’s power, Esvelt and his colleagues have since developed another approach, dubbed a daisy drive. It is a gene drive designed to fizzle out. It won’t self-propagate forever, but uses a series of connected drives that eventually do succumb to natural selection. Esvelt has also been brainstorming ways to keep a drive from spreading by making it so that when an edited organism procreates with a non-edited one, it will create half as many offspring—a kind of genetic electric-dog fence.
Despite these efforts, the public at large remains wary of the technology. Media organizations regularly use the word “risky” to describe it. In 2016, a group of 30 environmentalists and scientists called for a moratorium on gene drive, asserting that any release would be too dangerous. In 2018, a similar proposal at the 2018 UN Convention on Biological Diversity was rebuffed in part by an open letter from more than a hundred scientists, including Esvelt, Church, and Burt, arguing against a moratorium.
Esvelt doesn’t wholly disagree. He’s often a source in articles about the risks. Since the 2014 paper, he’s spoken publicly about how stringent the standards for using original self-propagating gene drive should be, and the need for any trial to start small and scale up. (Esvelt does think that malaria is one of the very few cases where the full, self-propagating drive’s benefits can rival the risks.) Still, he exists on his moral seesaw: What are the consequences of doing nothing? Of being too cautious, spreading too much hesitation about gene drives? How many people  could they be saving?
In a way, Esvelt got lucky with gene drive. As far as big, dangerous ideas go, it’s better to have one that spreads through reproduction—it’s slow and limited to organisms that sexually reproduce (not bacteria and viruses). You can’t hide it. Sequencing DNA would quickly reveal that a CRISPR gene drive is present.
But the dangerous idea that Esvelt walked away with was not gene drive. It was that one day a technology could not exist, and then the next day, it could. Its sudden genesis could threaten to affect the lives of millions of people who did not consent to it, propagate on its own, and have completely unpredictable side effects. At any moment, we could be on the cusp of the next big dangerous idea in artificial intelligence, or human-machine interfaces, or synthetic biology. “It doesn't give us any time to think about the implications, possible offenses, and so forth,” Esvelt said. “Everything is on one person. And so that was a deeply uncomfortable position to be in.”
Esvelt grew up between Portland and Seattle, where it’s not hard to be stupefied by nature’s grandeur—“Lots of running around in the forest.” His mother was an elementary school teacher and his father worked for Bonneville Power Administration, but they recognized that their son was entranced with biology, especially dinosaurs. Though he was only in third grade at the time, he read  Jurassic Park when it first came out, and thought he would grow up to be a paleontologist.
In the sixth grade, his parents took him to the Galápagos Islands. The trip led to Esvelt reading the writings of Charles Darwin, whom he still speaks of with reverence. Evolution gave Esvelt a guide to how life works—“nothing makes sense in biology except in the light of evolution,” as the geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky famously wrote. But though evolution is comprehensive, it is far from a rule book.
Esvelt called evolution a “blind idiot alien god” (a nod to H.P. Lovecraft), and it was a difficult realization for him that his guidebook to life had no moral compass. “It evolved things that cause horrific suffering, and it doesn’t care because there’s nothing there to care,” he said. “It’s just an emergent process. But we care.”
Esvelt cared a lot—he described himself as a radical environmentalist in high school, a teenager who loved the natural world, and was hell-bent on stopping humans from destroying it. Ben Brown, a professor in astrophysics at the University of Colorado Boulder, who went to high school and college with Esvelt, said that they would often discuss problems on the bus to track and field competitions—like humanity’s impacts on global ecosystems and how to support growing populations without running out of natural resources.
Esvelt’s environmentalism was different from the radical “tree-hugger, chainsaw-sabotaging, bike-riding-for-peace-and-world-saving brand of environmentalism,” that was common in the Portland area, Brown said. Esvelt was more about radical  ideas. He once felt that since the sun would eventually destroy Earth, the only way to preserve life long-term would be directed panspermia, or shooting out some version of life into the universe to develop elsewhere. (Esvelt now thinks directed panspermia is morally reprehensible.)
In college, Esvelt continued to generate big, radical ideas, Brown said. His undergraduate thesis was on studying fertilin beta, a sperm surface protein. His goal: to figure out a way to induce reversible male sterility, so that every act of procreation should be intentional; he thought that making a baby should be an opt-in rather than opt-out situation (and that the responsibility should fall to men for a change).
Brown remembered talking with him about it, saying, “Kevin, on the one hand, this makes perfect sense. That’s a great idea. But how in the hell could you ever give corporations control over the fertility of mankind, of humankind? How is this ever going to work? College-age Kevin had a hard time seeing the dark sides that could come out of those choices and technologies, and largely just saw the benefits and advantages that could come out of them, and ways to try and solve problems that he saw as critical to solve in the world.”
That all changed with CRISPR gene drive. The last time Brown saw Esvelt in Boston, he reflected on just how much time Esvelt dedicated to the potential outcomes of his work. “He had spent as much, or more, time thinking about some of the long-term moral and ethical impacts as most of my colleagues would spend on just the straight-up research parts.\\"
Esvelt’s lab today is called Sculpting Evolution. On paper, their mission is to research evolutionary and ecological engineering. But Esvelt has greater ideological and philosophical stakes. “Our long-term mission is cultivating wisdom,” he explained. He sees his work as not only to sculpt the evolution of living systems, but to help shape the evolution of technology, and provide some of the morality that evolution lacks. The young man with the big ideas started to grasp just how big they were. “The future of our civilization is primarily going to be determined by the technologies that we invent and the wisdom with which we choose whether, when, and how to use them,” he said.
One place Esvelt is trying to exercise this wisdom, and what careful implementation of a new technology looks like, is on Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket in Massachusetts. The project is called Mice Against Ticks. In the summer of 2016, Esvelt’s lab reached out to the Nantucket Board of Health to present the possibility of using a gene drive on white-footed mice in the area that infect ticks with Lyme disease. It was an intriguing pitch, said the director of the health and human services department, Roberto SantaMaria, because about 40 percent of the island’s population has had Lyme disease at one point.
Esvelt and his PhD student Joanna Buchthal gave a presentation explaining gene drive and CRISPR to the entire group. On a Facebook group for yearlong residents, the page lit up with discussions about Esvelt and his proposals. The reactions, in SantaMaria’s recollection, were mixed: “Everyone’s mind jumped to Jurassic Park.”
The residents viewed Esvelt as an “egghead” swooping in from Boston to alter their land, SantaMaria continued. But Esvelt kept coming back—in the first year, Esvelt and Buchthal gave a handful of presentations. Every few months, they talked to 30 or 40 more people, and even more watching a livestream online. “The openness of his research, the openness and his willingness to prevent anything from going wrong really caught us off guard,” SantaMaria said. “It really made us trust him.” Sam Telford, an epidemiologist who has been focused on Lyme disease and other tick-transmitted infections for 35 years, said that Esvelt has given so many presentations, “it rivals my speaking on both islands over, I don’t know, the past 10 or 15 years.”
But despite all that time and energy, Esvelt is currently  not pursuing a CRISPR gene drive—the communities said they preferred him not to. “One of the things they said was to try to keep it as natural as you can,” Esvelt explained. Instead, they are using a genetic modification to make mice that continuously produce the antibodies for Lyme disease, and to make offspring able to inherit that immunity from their parents.
One could argue that it is also not “natural” for a mouse to inherit resistance from their parents—that’s not how immune systems “naturally” work. Esvelt knows the categorization is subjective, but he is putting his money where his mouth is. “If it’s your environment, it’s your call,” he said. “We don’t live there. We’re not going to be affected if you decided to do this.”
Telford admitted that the project would likely be a lot easier using a gene drive, but that’s not the point. “The history of public health is that there are many examples of interventions that are forced down people’s throats,” Telford said. “[Kevin] has a very refreshing approach of actually involving the communities from the very start, letting them know, ‘Look...This is what we want to do. Before there’ll be any kind of release in your communities, you will vote and you will have an opportunity to say no.’”
Esvelt sees his role as either a facilitator or enabler, not someone making a pitch. He’s not about finding a place to fast-track a trial for gene drive, but to develop a framework for how to approach communities with genetic technology in the future—in a way that’s inclusive, respectful, and starts small. To cultivate the most wisdom, we need to encourage collective power without individual access—not create situations where a single person has access to the proverbial big red button, he said. Even (or especially) if that person is him.
“Mice Against Ticks in and of itself does not exist because I think Lyme disease is the most important problem in the world that I could be working on,” Esvelt said. “Rather, it exists because I want to change science and make it more open in this area of ecological editing. The best way of doing that is choosing a local problem with particularly relevant communities who could set an example for how things should be done elsewhere in the United States, and ideally elsewhere in the world.”
As technology advances and trickles out into the real world, science will continue to face this hard truth: It has to grapple with people’s values and moral beliefs as much as the hard data and facts. “We base our discussions on scientific evidence as well, but it’s not the only factor that comes into play,” said Jennifer Kuzma, a professor and the co-director of the genetic engineering and society center at North Carolina State, who has been studying the governance of emerging biotechnologies for more than 20 years. “It’s informed by science but not dictated by science.”
Esvelt thinks scientists come with their own values and biases too. “People likely to become scientists do so because they have a particular set of predilections and traits that encouraged them to think about things in a reductionist, materialist manner,” Esvelt said. “It’s a self-sorting group. It doesn’t mean that you should have that much power because of your differences. It does not mean that you are unusually wise.”
Scientists are asked to specialize in niche subjects, “down, down, down, until you’re in the lightless caverns that have never been explored,” Esvelt said. He finds this dangerous. Communication within the sciences is just as important as with the public; with highly specialized people working in isolated fields, they could accidentally unleash new technologies.
In 2015, at the University of California in San Diego, researchers were studying genes that create vein patterns in fruit fly wings. They figured out they could use CRISPR to make different mutant flies, and also make certain flies yellow, to tell them apart. It was a CRISPR-gene drive. They also recognized the changes could be inherited and self-propagate, and took safety and containment measures. But Esvelt was still concerned: If one of those flies had gotten out, it could have made a whole bunch of local fruit flies yellow. Not necessarily dangerous on its own, but what if a simple accident like this sparked a media frenzy, and turned the public against gene drive, halting ongoing malaria research?
One accident could affect the whole future of this work. In 1999, a patient died while participating in a gene therapy trial at the University of Pennsylvania, which \\"really slowed down...the field for a decade at least,\\" according to Kuzma. \\"Could it happen in the case of gene drive? Yeah,\\" she said.
According to Esvelt, the way science is structured now, we can only expect more mistakes. Researchers work essentially in secret and don’t reveal what they’re working on until they’re done. “That’s not fair,” he said. “But at the same time, these consequences are very real.”
Radical transparency isn’t realistic for everyone—in a world of competing for funding and publication in top journals to secure said funding, laying all your cards out on the table could leave PhD students without pay or leave smaller labs vulnerable to others stealing their ideas.
Telford said that Esvelt has the “luxury of being able to think of these bigger pictures that we scientists in general really should have in the back of our minds, because he’s in the Media Lab at MIT. I was kidding him a while ago, saying, ‘Well look, you’re at MIT, this is like a top-echelon science institution in the world. Shouldn’t you be writing real hard science papers?’ And he has this big smile on his face and says, ‘No, no, I’m in the Media Lab. The only thing that matters to me is making an impact socially and culturally and politically.’”
It’s one of the reasons Esvelt pushes so hard on communication and openness, because he has the privilege of being able to do so. But he hopes that even a “typical” scientist will start to realize that they don’t operate in a vacuum. Research choices can greatly impact people far removed from the lab bench, just like decisions about who to accept funding from can have unexpected and sinister ripple effects.
Do scientists regularly calculate the consequences for their actions? Have they added up the number of lives, or the amount of suffering, they could cause or absolve? “The answer is no, they haven’t,” Esvelt said. “You asked what frustrates me about the world. That’s what frustrates me, that people don’t think that way. They don’t connect morality to mathematics.”
As we spoke, I started to realize that while Esvelt is applauded for exhaustively involving the communities he plans to work with, lauded as an advocate for openness and cooperation—all true—there is also a piece of this tireless cooperation that is just as much for his sake as it is for theirs; to disperse that responsibility in some small way, and to ask for help, because he holds himself personally responsible for the consequences of whatever may go wrong.
\\"I’m morally responsible for all of the consequences of this technology,\\" he said. \\"Even if someone else uses it and screws it up, that’s still, to some extent, my fault.”
Esvelt has been described by other journalists as haunted, and I can see how people might think that. But while he seems to fully sense the gravity of his position, he is also an upbeat, excitable person. “I like drama more than is good for me, perhaps,” he said. “But on the whole, I’m a pretty cheerful person.”
His worldview similarly contains a number of contradictions. He believes that we need technological advances to continue our “ascent up the tree of knowledge,” but he also thinks that that same tree could bear fruit that threatens the stability and safety of human life. He insists we need to pay attention to people’s values and take them seriously, yet also believes those same values could be completely wrong. “The moral worldviews of humans have changed tremendously over the past few centuries,” he said.
So how do we decide what to do? It’s an age-old philosophical question, and one Esvelt is intent on bringing to the sciences. And I got the sense from him that while he takes his mission very seriously, he also enjoys it. When debating moral reasoning, his already quick-paced speaking speeds up, invigorated by the discussion. What is the moral code that one should follow? Should we focus solely on the consequences of our actions to decide? Or on the integrity of our intentions?
He told me that he isn’t a fan of using consequentialism on a day-to-day basis, and it relieved me to know that Esvelt doesn’t apply his mortality calculations to everything. He doesn’t, for example, stand in the produce section of the grocery store counting up deaths when comparing organic to non-organic bananas. In everyday life, he turns to other philosophical role models, like Aristotle, and the Stoics Marcus Aurelius and Seneca. Aristotle’s view on ethics was that morality should be practical and not just relegated to theory. If a person wanted to be virtuous, they must do virtuous things, and not spend their time studying and pontificating about what virtue is. Esvelt said that in his life, he tries to combine that with a crucial insight from the Stoics, which is: If there’s nothing you can do about it, don’t stress.
The thing is, though, the range of things that Esvelt can affect with his actions is a bit larger than, say, mine. I cannot personally change the DNA of a malaria-carrying mosquito, or a mouse carrying Lyme disease. Esvelt can. Can philosophical wisdom help him with the weight of that burden? Would Esvelt be happier if he didn’t need his envelope calculations, if he hadn’t come up with CRISPR gene drive, if he didn’t have to watch his words carefully, or think about the moral ramifications of every action?
“I wouldn’t trade my job for the world,” he said, smiling. After a pause he continued, “I mean, I would. I would  totally trade my job for the world. I would trade my life for the world. That’s sort of part of what comes with this, right?”",
